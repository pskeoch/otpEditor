issues
------------
-special characters, need to test xml creation with all titles, also need to work out display
	-question - does xml creation break if output to file rather than to webpage?

-Where is colors.txt file? Can't find example to copy

-consolidate save functions in one php file

-do I need to check parent_is_language_id to be safe?

-Seems to be odd character in section 1313 content text. Not clear what is issue or how prevalent in database

- Languages attribute display not working for Volvo, other elements also seem problem with Volvo

- assume picture galleries/wallpaper sections only occur on the top hierarchy?

- email links not working, don't seem to be working in original? Need change to explicit "mailto"?

- In brands table and colors.txt there is "htmlColorBg", but is not referenced in Editor help guide and Jaguar does not have a value for this

- want visible navigation guide to tell you where you are in the structure

- xml procedure currently goes 5 levels deep. What if more required?
